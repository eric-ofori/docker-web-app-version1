Create a simple HTML file named "index.html" inside the "version1" folder. The HTML file will be a basic login form you would like to display.
Create a Dockerfile in the "version1" folder. Dockerfiles are what tell docker how it should build your image (environments)
Using an online terminal or local. Ensure you are able to access your project files
Run the build commands
Ensure you can see your new custom image (docker images)
Run the Image to confirm it works
Finally, If all is right, let's push the image to a docker Hub repo
